### ðŸ“ƒ Project specifications

European football is made up of the 5 major European leagues, each of which is made up of various series
(e.g. Italian league: Serie A and Serie B).<br>
In each series there are a maximum of 8 teams, made up of a number of players that varies for each
team and which must be greater than 11.<br>
Each team is characterized by a score in the standings, a location (City, street, house number) and a balance in
euro for the market.<br>
The players are divided into 4 roles (goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and forwards) and are characterized by
a personal data, an age, a sponsor (not necessary) and a market value expressed in euros.<br>
Each series has a calendar showing all the matches of the season, played and still from
to play. For each match there is the matchday number and the possible result.<br>
From a dedicated web page a user can:
- view the series of the championship;
- view the teams of a series;
- view the players of a team divided by role and in increasing order of age;
- view the ranking and the schedule of a series;
- view the results of a day of a series;
- view a single meeting;

- view all players under a certain age in ascending order of age;
- view the matches with results with 3 or more goal difference played in a series;
- view the most frequent nationalities in a team of a series;
- view the players of a certain nationality in a series;
- view the players of a certain role in a series;
-add a result of a match not yet played;
-Transfer a player from one team to another respecting the available balance of a team.
